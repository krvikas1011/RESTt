# RESTt

RESTt or REST-tracing provides a mechanism to trace REST calls made in or out of another REST call. This will in turn enable the consumers to have an overview of how their REST architecture and dependencies look like.

Other features include:
  - Finding upstream and downstream dependencies
  - Tracing the data flowing between APIs. 
  - Getting the bottlenecks/pain points in the system.

Problem Statement:
> Systems hosting REST APIs face a lack of insight between upstream and
> downstream API Calls within and outside of their system. 
> This leads to tracibility of any issues or bottlenecks being extremely difficult. 
> Also, there is a a black box around the performance of the entire system which can only
> be measured by looking into each API manually, which for a large system, is quite tedious.
