# RESTt
RESTt or REST-tracing provides a mechanism to trace REST calls made in or out of another REST call. This will in turn enable the consumers to have aoverviee of how their REST architecture and dependencies looks like.

This will provide other features like:
-> Finding upstream and downstream dependencies
-> Tracing the data flowing between APIs and in turn getting the bottlenecks/pain points in the system.
